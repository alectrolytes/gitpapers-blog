First Post!

Pretty amazing day today. Finished my first hackathon at CodeDay @Philly and won two awards for my Squelch app. I met a bunch of awesome people (and cool projects) who helped me learn Xcode and obj-C in order to finish my program! Then my lost wallet was returned to the movie theatre where I lost it. After today, I learned that anything is possible if you really want it. Let's see if I can keep making the day better :D
