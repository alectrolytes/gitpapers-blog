<strong>Website is up!...kind of.</strong>

What's up github. I spent the last couple of days planning and putting up my website. I've been learning HTML/CSS for the last week and it still looks challenging to build and design a website from scratch.
I decided on using github.io since it will help me learn how to use GitHub and add pieces of my website together. My current plans with the website is to make an About Me and a Challenge List/Signature Book. Not sure what is immediately next, since I have a lot of options. Of course I can't leave it to just print "Hello World"!
